# Useful animations

This is a compilation of projects I've built over time to study and have samples of animations.

## Projects

- **full-page-scroll** - A demonstration of whole page sections and scrolling with ease between them;
- **page-scroll-snap-native** - An attempt of reproducing `full-page-scroll` using only native css (notice the clunky animation);
